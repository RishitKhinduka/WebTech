    <h3>Why I chose Babson:</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Rishit and I am senior at Babson College. Looking back, I chose
      this university due to its esteemed reputation for being the #1
      entrepreneurship school in the world. Hence, I wanted to gain in-depth
      knowledge of not only how to create a business but also manage existing
      business like my family business. As for the aspirations after graduating
      this December, I look forward to pursuing a career in Real Estate, while
      also join my family jewelry business.

    <h3>My favorite sport:</h3>
    <p>
      One of my favorite sports is football (soccer). Although I enjoy a variety
      of sports like Badminton and Basketball, I have played football since
      childhood. It all began in 2014 Fifa world cup, when Brazil lost to
      Germany with a score of 7-1. Ever since then I have enjoyed watching world
      cups and champion leagues, and I have enjoyed playing it even more!

      My favorite player is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo" target="_blank"
        >Cristiano Ronaldo</a
      >, who is often regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time.
      He has won multiple awards and has set numerous world records throughout
      his football career. I adore his dedication and decipline which has made
      him the best player in the world of football.
