# Reflection – Development & AI Collaboration

## Development Reflection
1. Challenges: 
  - One of the main challenges I was facing was part 4 of the home work where I had to calculate scores for multiple questions at once. I tried doing it but something was wrong and the output did not add of the scores. 

2. Solutions:  
- Therefore, I searched online how to do it and then came across the forEach loops. Then by using the forEach loop and querySelector, I was able to total up the scores and then give an output with the message. I understand how important learning to code is, but what is more important is to learn how to search up and understand how to debug your issue. 


## AI Usage Summary
1. The AIs used: I used GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT

2. Prompts / Requests:
- I majorly used it for cleaning up the code and making it smaller and simpler in order to prevent any mistake in coding further. However, I did ask it to teach me how to add a background image behind the quiz box in Part 4. I said, “Now in the code provided to you below, I want to add an image of a car in the background. Your goal is to tell me how to do it without changing the given code or enhancing anything else:”  
- Then, it gave me an appropriate response where it just gave me the line of the code and told me where I should add it and how can I make it better, either by adding blur or making it black and white. 


## Reflection on AI Collaboration
1. Benefits:   
  - There are several benefits in collaboration with AI as it not only speeds up the process of debugging but also provide newer, easier and cleaner way to solve the problem. It also provide not one but multiple solutions which I liked the most. 

2. Limitations: 
  - Although it provided me with immediate solutions, it often changed the code or added something new even after explicitly mentioning in the prompt to not change anything and keep it the same. Therefore, it still requires a thorough review in order to make sure everything is the same. You cannot just copy and paste AI’s outputs.  

3. Future Use:
- Use AI as a guide and as a tool for coding.
- Understanding how to give me the correct prompt is the best way to get the most accurate answers. 
- Make sure to break prompts into smaller questions for better clarity and adding the sentence, “If you have any questions or doubts, ask me and clear it in order to give me the most accurate and appropriate answer.”
