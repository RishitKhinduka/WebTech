# Reflection for HomeWork 1 
# Unknowns List:
background: url(...) center/cover no-repeat; dont know 
@media (max-width: ...) dont know 
background: linear-gradient(...), gradient backgrounds 
border-radius, rounder coners 
gap, for spacing 
# At least three insights: 
One of the main things that I learned specifically after using AI for this assignment, is how crucial it is frame the prompt perfectly and in order. Initially, when creating the AI-revised versions, even after specifying to create them inside of a specific folder, copilot failed to do so. When I looked what went wrong, I had spelled the folder name incorrectly in the prompt and hence the result. Secondly, by asking follow-up questions regarding the prompts, I was able to better refine my work with better efficiency, which taught me that instead of giving three to four actions in one prompt, it is much better to break those actions into individual prompts. This allowed me to significantly increase the accuracy of Copilot. Lastly, for part three where we could use advanced CSS, I described how I wanted the site to look, and its response was amazing! Not only did it tell me how to go about it but also gave suggestions on how to further improve my design.
# AI Generated snippet:
<!-- <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Description">
</div> -->
I asked Copilot how to center the image, because initially I used the margin tag to format the image, but it was looking sophisticated. Hence, it gave me this output, similar to what we learned in the last class. This allowed me to use the CSS Flexbox to horizontally centre the image.
# Issues:
I had an issue with the home.jpg image as it was not loading in the preview page. However, with the help of AI, I fixed it. The issue was that the SRC was wrong and hence it was not reading the home.jpg file correctly. Similarly, in the portfolio page, my links to other HTML files were not working, majorly due to the source “HREF” attribute. Copilot fixed it and I understood why the issue arose. 
# Final Reflection: 
As someone who had not coded before, this assignment greatly impacted not only the learnings but also how to use AI into better understanding the issue. There were a lot of challenges I faced in the part 1 of the assignment where we could not use Copilot as all the issues I ran into, either I was not able to find a solution for it, or it took me extremely long to figure out what I had done wrong. With the help of AI, I was able to fast track that process. Therefore, in the future, I plan to use HTML/CSS to create website for my future businesses
