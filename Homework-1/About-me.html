    <h2>About Me: Rishit Khinduka</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My name is Rishit and I am a senior at Babson College. I spent the initial
      years of my childhood in Japan and soon shifted back to India for
      schooling. Although at the time it seemed like a big shift, studying in
      India has not only allowed me to learn and grasp knowledge properly, but
      also presented me with the opportunity to stay connected to my roots. Soon
      came the time to decide and plan my future, and that is when I applied to
      Babson and got accepted. 
        </p>

      Looking back, I chose this university due to its
      esteemed reputation for being the #1 entrepreneurship school in the world.
      Hence, I wanted to gain in-depth knowledge of not only how to create a
      business but also manage existing business like my family business. Given
      my grand aspirations after graduating this December, I believe the
      knowledge and the experience will allow me to prosper in fulfilling my
      future endeavours of starting a Real Estate company, while also growing my
      family jewelry business.
