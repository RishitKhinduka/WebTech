    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My interests include traveling, watching TV series, and playing different
      types of sports. I love exploring new places and experiencing different
      cultures. Traveling has always given me the peace of mind and it allows me
      to broaden my horizons by gaining new perspectives on life and how to do
      things.
    </p>

    <p>
      As for my favorite sports, I am a die-hard fan of football (soccer).
      Although I enjoy a variety of sports like Badminton and Basketball, I have
      played football since childhood. It all began in 2014 Fifa world cup, when
      Brazil lost to Germany with a score of 7-1. Ever since then I have enjoyed
      watching world cups and champion leagues, and I have enjoyed playing it
      even more!
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorite player is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo" target="_blank"
        >Cristiano Ronaldo</a
      >, who is often regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time.
      He has won multiple awards and has set numerous world records throughout
      his football career. I adore his dedication and decipline which has made
      him the best player in the world of football and I aspire to be like him
      one day.
