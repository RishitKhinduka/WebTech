# HW2 Reflection – Rishit Khinduka (AI was used to format the document)

# Development Reflection:

# Overall Experience: 
For my manual version, I built my website entirely in VS Code using basic HTML and CSS, following a structured approach as provided in the hw2.md. Started by creating the content plan and on the basis of it created the three HTML pages (Index, Projects, Contacts). 


# Challenges and How I Solved Them: 
1. Broken Image Paths My project images were not showing up initially because of the wrong src being used. I fixed this by checking whether the image was trying to use was in the same folder or not and hence fixed the issue there. 
2. Centering the Header Title: The heading “Rishit Khinduka” was not centered because of mixed absolute and static positioning. I could not fix it. When I moved on to part 2 of the assignment where I could use AI, I asked what was wrong and it explain me that by separating the logo and title in HTML and using proper CSS positioning (absolute for the logo, text-align for the title), the issue could be fixed. 


### New Skills and Insights Gained
- Semantics HTML: I thoroughly learned and used elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` improve both accessibility and structure.
- **Responsive Design with Pure CSS:** I now understand how to use Flexbox and Grid without frameworks, keeping the layout elegant, simple and consistent across different devices. 

# AI Iterative Summary:

# Strategy and Process
Used AI to improve the pages it had given me: 
- **Round 1:** I provided my content plan and asked AI to generate new versions of `index-hw2-ai.html`, `projects-hw2-ai.html`, and `contact-hw2-ai.html` with consistent styling in `hw2-styles-ai.css`.
- **Rounds 2–3:** I focused on improving responsiveness, readability, and spacing. 
- **Rounds 4–5:** I allowed creative freedom — AI helped implement subtle visual effects (e.g., gradient backgrounds, drop shadows, and balanced spacing) and refined small details that I overlooked. 

### Key Patterns in AI Responses
- Chatgpt specifically, always produced clean and accurate code while also adding or refining more stylistic features (e.g., gradients, shadows) than I initially planned.

### Breakthroughs and Improvements
- AI showed how to use `repeat(auto-fit, minmax())`, to make the project grid dynamically adjust. This was my first time using it and still dont understand its attributes as well. Lastly, Chatgpt also added `aria-labels` and proper alt text automatically.


## ⚖️ Comparative Analysis

### Manual vs. AI Initial Version
| Aspect | Manual Version | AI Initial Version |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|
| Design Style | Basic, minimal CSS | Elegant with gradient theme |
| Responsiveness | Manual Flex/Grid | Auto-fit Grid and modern queries |
| Code Readability | Simple and beginner-friendly | Clean but more advanced |
| Creativity | Practical and straightforward | Visually appealing and polished |

### AI Evolution Across Iterations
- It gradually improved structure consistency (eg: padding)
- Enhanced accessibility through proper alt attributes and fonts 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**AI Version Strengths:**
1. Professionally styled with better visual flow  
2. Highly responsive and polished design

**AI Version Weaknesses:**
1. Occasionally overused styling (too much shadow or contrast)  
2. After using AI, although the website was looking beautiful, I felt it was less “mine” when compared to original version


# Overall Reflection :

### Iterative Process Value
It was very clear after using the iterative process that it is far more effective than one-shot generation. Each iteration allowed me to refine and developed on the last feedback step by step.  

# Learning Experience
Through this process, I understood how to:
- Communicate precisely with AI using detailed prompts.
- Balance creative AI outputs with manual corrections.
- Combine AI-generated insights with my coding knowledge to create something uniquely mine.

# Future Strategies for AI Collaboration
- I believe the most important thing I have learned through this project is the need for a plan before codding for anything. If I would not have made the content plan to meet the requirements of the assignment, I would defenitiely have meesed up or missed a crucial part of the assignment
