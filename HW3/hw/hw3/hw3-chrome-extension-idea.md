## 3. Research
1. Existing Extension:   
  - Dashlane and LastPass 
  - Currently provide autofill and password management functionality but not soecifically for easyt checkouts.  
  
2. How This Extension Differs:  
  - Focused specifically on speeding up online purchases, not password management like Dashlane or LastPass.  
  - Adds one-click checkout for faster transactions while keeping credit card information safe.  
  - Also, it automatically selects delivery preferences, which existing autofill tools do not do (slected by the user previously and can be changed whenever the user prefers to change it).  
  - Save a lot of time and effort for repeated purchases like ordering household stuff every 2 weeks.
